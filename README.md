# Getting Started with Create React App

A website created using react.js and tailwind.css

## Installation
To run this on your local system, you should have python and VS code installed.
Now, you need to clone this repository, go to your command line and type

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shriyasankhyan/skillbee.git
```

The above command is used if you want to clone via HTTPS. You may do it with SSH or Github CLI as you want.

I have used tailwind and axios. Just run 

```bash
npm install
```

Just run the following command.

```bash
npm start
```

You will be able to check this website on your local system.
